A plugin for merging bzr's NEWS file.

This plugin is activated via configuration variables, see 'bzr help news_merge'.

This hook can resolve conflicts where both sides add entries at the same place.
If it encounters a more difficult conflict it gives up and bzr will fallback to
the default merge algorithm.
